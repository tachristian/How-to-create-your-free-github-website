Click Create repository.
Under Code > Quick Setup > Get started by creating a new file.
Name your file: index.html
Add any text you want to show on your site. 
Scroll down and click Commit new file.

##Publish Your Site 
Click Settings 
On the left menu click Pages. 
Under Branch, click the dropdown and select main. 
Click Save. 

Click Code, then Settings again to refresh, with in a minute you should see your websiteâ€™s URL at the top of the page in the format of:

GitHub Pages can use HTML or [Markdown Language](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) which is very easy.
